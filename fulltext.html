<b>"The ink on our finger is not enough"</b><br/><br/>

Voting session for Gujarat Municipal Corporation Elections were held today.<br/><br/>

But, I got disappointed about 2 things.<br/><br/>

1. Many voters, including me, does not have enough knowledge about the candidates (to whom they are supposed to vote).<br/>
2. All the candidates in the elections mostly win on the basis of marketing, word of mouth, relations and seniority. Not on the basis of their merit.<br/><br/>

May be all of us, voters and candidates should improve on this.<br/><br/>

<b>About point 1:</b><br/>
What we can do as a voter is:<br/><br/>
A. Educate ourselves about the election system completely.<br/>

[Not official, but a useful source on political science]<br/><br/>

B. We should be more aware about the development done in our locale, by the authorities.<br/><br/>

The percentage of voting is also low due to ignorance. Voters do not know whom to vote and so, many of them, just don't.<br/><br/>

<b>About point 2:</b><br/>
Coincidentally, I read today an article about meritocracy where the candidates who stands for important government positions are supposed to go through an examination.<br/>
After reading that, I think, there should be some improvements in the eligibility criteria of the candidates.Candidates' education might not be a good measure for this, but<br/>
 there should be a way to examine candidates knowledge and expertise with respect to the position he/she is applying for.<br/><br/>

Also, a detailed information of all the candidates should be shared officially and should be made easily available to voters including their ...<br/>
past works,<br/>
future plannings,<br/>
promises kept in the last term,<br/>
etc.<br/><br/>
<hr/>
As a responsible citizen, I will try and improvise to make better judgement in every election then the earlier.<br/>
I would like to get suggestions from my connections on this !<br/>
